# ArduboyFrogger

For this project, we recreated the classic game Frogger, porting it to the unique setting of an Arduboy. Frogger was released in 1981 and as of today has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The game was released in what is considered the "Golden Age" of video games and is considered timeless, appearing in various forms and across numerous platforms.

We wrote the game in C, mostly using the built-in functions for the Arduboy. Due to the smaller screen size of the Arduboy (128x64 pixels), the game is recreated in a more limited state with only 3 rows of cars/trucks.
